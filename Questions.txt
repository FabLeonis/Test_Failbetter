Q1) Read the C#/Unity code excerpt in 'Q1 Code Excerpt.png', which describes some functionality for the scouts in Sunless Skies.

Are there any improvements you would make to this code? Please take account of bugs, readability issues, potential language feature usage, and any other considerations you consider relevant.


Q2) Unity Project1 has a scene 'SampleScene' that contains an 'Asteroid' game object in the root of its hierarchy. Asteroid has a 2D collider attached.

In the same location, there is another game object named 'Manager'. Manager has a 'Plotter' behaviour attached with three buttons:

- Plot Points;
- Plot Buffer;
- Clear.

Manager also exposes two prefab references, 'PointPrefab' and 'BufferPrefab', and a float called 'BufferDistance'. In the MonoBehaviour script 'Assets/Plotter.cs' there are three corresponding function stubs.

Please implement these stubs as follows:

a) PlotPoints():  instantiate PointPrefab at intervals along the Asteroid's perimeter. 

b) PlotBuffer():  instantiate a similar number of BufferPrefab at a distance of BufferDistance outside the Asteroid's perimeter.

c) Clear(): remove all instantiated prefabs.

The number of prefabs instantiated should be enough to form a clear outline around the Asteroid, but beyond that, the exact number isn't important.

Also, it's acceptable if the processes produce some outliers; a sensible proof of concept will be sufficient.


Q3) Explain the difference between static classes and Singletons.

Discuss where and why you might see them in Unity or other projects.

Describe how you might make use of the Singleton pattern without the use of static classes.
